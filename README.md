# GeneralToBinaryTree
Converting a General Tree into a Binary Tree in java. Feel free to create issues.

I encountered this problem in a Data Structures and Algorithms course I am taking for high school and found it interesting. So, I went ahead and completed a program for it converting general trees into binary search trees.

Read [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-generic-treen-array-tree-to-binary-tree/) for more information about it.

also I was kinda lazy with the outputs :p
