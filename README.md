# GeneralToBinaryTree

I encountered these problems in a Data Structures and Algorithms course I am taking for high school and found it interesting.

Read [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-generic-treen-array-tree-to-binary-tree/) for more information about converting General Trees to Binary Search Trees.

also I was kinda lazy with the outputs :p
