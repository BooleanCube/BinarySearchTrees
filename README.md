# Binary Search Trees

I encountered these problems in a Data Structures and Algorithms course I am taking for high school and found it interesting. Binary Search Trees have been explained [here](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/32bst/).

Read [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-generic-treen-array-tree-to-binary-tree/) for more information about converting General Trees to Binary Search Trees.

also I was kinda lazy with the outputs :p
